// component-name-redux.js is the mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps, and connect functionality of Redux. If you use an alternative global state management tool, give it a similar file name, such as component-name-mobx.js. This allows you to harness multiple global states (if necessary, though not recommended) and allows you to easily swap global state managers in the future.
